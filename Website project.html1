    <h1><h2 style="color:white;"><p>There are about 10 septillion planets orbiting stars in the universe. We have 8 planets which we knowabout in our solar system.
        The first planet closest to the sun is called Mercury. It has no moons and has a solid surface. Just like the Moon, Mercury has craters all over it's surface. Mercury's surface is 333 degrees fahrenheit(167 degrees celsius).The day on Mercury also lasts longer than Earth's.
        The second planet closest to the sun is Venus. It takes Venus 243 earth days to sping a full rotation once. Despite being further away from the sun than Mercury, Venus is hotter than Mercury. This because Venus has more greenhouse gases than Mercury allowing it to trap more heat.
        The third planet from the sun is the Earth. There are about 7.9 billion people who live on earth. There is a moon which orbits Earth. This is what creates the day and night cycle. You can fit a million Earths into the sun.
        The forth planet from the sun is Mars. Mars is hypothesised to have been vibrant like Earth. Scientists believe that we can terraform the planet to make it able to support life. Mars currently has been identified to have 2 moons.
        The fifth planet from the sun is Jupiter. Jupiter is extremely large. It is theorised that you could fit 1,300 Earths in Jupiter. Jupiter has a total of 80 moons orbiting it. 57 are officially named and 23 are not named.
        The sixth planet from the sun is Saturn. Saturn has a large ring. Other planets might also have rings though we can't see them. Saturn's rings is be made up of rocks, ice and dust.
        The seventh planet from the sun is Uranus. Uranus has the 3rd largest diameter in our solar system. Uranus has 27 moons and has 2 sets of rings.
        The eighth planet from the sun is Neptune. Neptune could not be seen from Earth except with telescopes and was the first planet to be mathematically predicted to exist.
